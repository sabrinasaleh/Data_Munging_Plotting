Based on the data at hand,  Money and investment oppurtunities only flow one way through the continent of
Africa. With over 50% of the countries still being classified as third world classification, many do not have the resources 
and monetary capital to invest outside of their own nation. The nations that stood out the most were 
Nigeria and South Africa which had considerable higher GDP's than the latter, with only South Africa being a solid contributor 
to overseas investment oppurtunities. With Nigeria exporting out Natural Resources and South African cashing in on the 
same as well and being top tourism destination, other countries in the region can learn and figure out a way to look to 
a brighter future for their country.
